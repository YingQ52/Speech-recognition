# Speech-recognition
## Trigger Word Detection
 - Structure a speech recognition project
 - Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
 - Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions

## 1 - Data synthesis: Creating a speech dataset

created three types of recordings: (positives/negatives/backgrounds)

## 2 - Model
 This network used 4 layers: A convolutional layer, Two GRU layers, and A dense layer. 

## 3 - Making Predictions
